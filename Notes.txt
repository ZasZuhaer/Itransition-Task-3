What I learned while doing task 3,
Express.js: provide routing system to manage HTTP methods
Node.js: javascript but in your console

we can use postman to test non interfacial websites to test functions
console.log() is for printing something in the console (well, as the name says)
return res.send() is how we return a response after a HTTP request is made, the response can be visible in postman when returned

"web methods" this term means http get, post, put, patch, delete methods
when validating natural number inputs make sure it omits scientific notation numbers (5e2), hexadecimal numbers (0x3) and math expressions
natural numbers means only natural numbers, nothing else
